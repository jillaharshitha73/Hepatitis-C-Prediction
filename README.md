# Hepatitis-C-Prediction
Hepatitis prediction typically involves using medical data to determine the likelihood that a person has or may develop hepatitis (commonly Hepatitis A, B, or C). This can be done manually by doctors based on test results and symptoms or automatically through machine learning (ML) models using health records.

If you're referring to a machine learning-based hepatitis prediction model, here's a general outline of how it works:

âœ… Steps for Hepatitis Prediction Using ML:
Dataset Collection:

# Common dataset: UCI Hepatitis Dataset

Features: Age, sex, bilirubin levels, liver function test results, etc.

Target: Whether the patient lives or dies (in some datasets), or whether hepatitis is present or not.

# Data Preprocessing: 
Handle missing values.
Normalize or standardize data.
Encode categorical variables.

# Model Selection:

Algorithms like:
Logistic Regression
Decision Trees
Random Forest
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Neural Networks

# Model Training:
Split data into training and testing sets.
Train the model on the training set.

# Model Evaluation:
Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC.

# Prediction:
Input new patient data into the trained model to predict hepatitis.
